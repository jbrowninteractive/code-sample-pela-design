Joseph Brown | Full Stack Code Sample

## Description

Sample of code I've written for a Lanscape Architecture company. The site includes a reponsive front-end with Jade, custom CMS with social networking verification, node.js/express backend-end, MongoDB storage. The site is hosted on a AWS EC2 instance and pushed using some small bash scripts you can find in the tools directory.
